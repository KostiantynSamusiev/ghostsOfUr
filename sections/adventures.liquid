        <p>The Ubaid period 67OO BCE â€” 3700 BCE has ended. Small groups of native peoples from all over Western Europe are aware, through rumor and gossip that the "Light of the East" is just over the next sunrise.</p>
        <p>The first and greatest cities of Sumer are in existence, waiting to be traversed for the rewards that they can offer. Take the journey, discover the majesty, collect the needed currency and supplies. Find and demand of Nanna what it is want at days end. Climb Mountains, sail across waters, trek through deserts, strategically conflict with all of Sumer, and each in your quest.</p>

He misunderstood an altercation with his group and was ostracized after some violence led to the death of most ot them. Anglean wanders Central Europe aimlessly smashing his way from one event to the next. After someone pointed him East in 3793 BCE he decided to go there. A journey of 1000 miles for what he believes to be a lifetime supply of free food and a loving family to eat it with."

Balfarg curiosity and love of the natural world are coupled equally with hos sorrow over the death of his daughter. In 3893 BCE, towards the end of his life, Balfarg chose th wander East after a rumor he had heard of a place filled with natural wonders and redemption. Balfarg desperately wants to appease the God of the Earth in the hopes that he can bring back his daughter."
