        "Pewter": "At our Buffalo, NY facility, we take great pride in the meticulous craftsmanship of our game components. Each character in our adventure game is carefully hand-casted using premium pewter, resulting in figures that range in height from 25mm to 40mm. The attention to detail extends to their weight, with each adventurer weighing between 11g to 16g, adding a substantial and satisfying feel to the game pieces.\n\nTo further enhance the aesthetics and capture the essence of the ancient era, we offer two striking finishes for our pewter figures: Antiqued Blackened Pewter and Plain Pewter. The Antiqued Blackened Pewter finish adds a touch of antiquity, while the Plain Pewter finish highlights the natural beauty and luster of the metal.\n\nBy combining our passion for board games with our commitment to excellence in production, we strive to provide you with an immersive and visually stunning gaming experience. Our locally crafted pewter figures serve as a testament to our dedication to quality and authenticity."
